## Description

A [Responsive Master Detail Component](https://margozzi.github.io/MasterDetail) built with React. Renders like GMail on a phone and like a table in larger diaplys. Three breakpoints can be set. The number of table columns to display can be set for each reakpoint.
Try it out on your mobile device. Then try the same app on your laptop/desktop and resize your browser window to see the responsive nature of the compoennt. Also notice the use of some keyboard controls ( up and down arrow and esc keys ). There are options to have the detail panel be inline or floating. You can also try it with an array of data ( canned ) or making network requests.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
